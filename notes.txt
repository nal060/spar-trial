 What would elevate it:

  1. Ask a sharper question. Instead of "does LDA     
  work?" (Goodfire already showed it does), ask       
  something like: "Do behaviors surfaced by LDA       
  between SFT and RLVR checkpoints differ
  qualitatively from those surfaced between base and  
  SFT checkpoints?" That's a comparative analysis with
   actual insight about what RLVR specifically        
  introduces.
  2. Improve the attribution validation. Right now you
   have no way to know if attribution results are     
  meaningful. You could do a simple sanity check:     
  attribute benign outputs too, then test whether     
  harmful outputs have systematically different       
  attribution patterns than benign ones.
  3. Go beyond keyword classification. The heuristic  
  classifier is a real weakness. If you can't use the 
  Claude API, even a small open classifier (like a    
  toxicity model from HuggingFace) would be more      
  credible.
  4. Vary the checkpoint pairs. OLMo has intermediate 
  checkpoints. Comparing multiple pairs could reveal  
  when during training certain behaviors get
  introduced, which is a more interesting finding than
   just "LDA amplifies stuff."

  The project as-is reads like a tutorial or
  replication exercise. For a SPAR trial, the
  evaluators likely want to see research taste — that 
  you made choices about what to investigate, not just
   ran someone else's method end-to-end. I'd pick one 
  of the extensions above and make it the core        
  contribution.
