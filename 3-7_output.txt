INTERPRETATION
======================================================================

- High overlap/correlation: Methods agree on what's relevant
- Low overlap/correlation: Methods capture different signals (interesting!)
- Unanimous docs: High-confidence attributions (all methods agree)
- Method-only docs: Each method's unique contribution

The key question (answered in Phase 4):
Which method's flagged docs, when removed, most reduces the harmful behavior?
